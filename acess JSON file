const app = require("express")();
app.listen(3000);
app.on("/json", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile("./filename.json");
});
Then, input these in a command prompt:

1. npm init
(then put in the values)

2. npm i express

3. node server.js
And that should let you access the file from anywhere on the web while your computer is running. Just go to https://[youripaddress]:3000/json
